    text: <b>ArcGIS Maps SDK for Unity</b> is a plugin developed by Esri that enables
      access to real world maps and 3D content from the ArcGIS Platform. This plugin
      provides samples and an API to create interactive, photorealistic 3D and XR
      experiences with geospatial data

    text: 'The ArcGISMapsSDK plugin requires either the Universal Render Pipeline package or the High Definition Render Pipeline package to make the plugin work. You can download either package via the Package Manager, and the plugin allows you to install both packages together in a project'

    text: 'The ArcGISMapsSDK plugin contains two sample levels that make it easy
      to understand how to use the plugin in your project. You are free to use the
      levels as starting point for your own levels. Each sample scene is a different
      path for developing content using the plugin and can be categorized by ease
      of use. You can find the sample scenes in the content folder: ArcGISMapsSDK/Samples'

    text: <b>- Prefab:</b> The Prefab Scene provides an intuitive User Interface
      for adding GIS content to a scene. It is by far the easiest route to getting
      GIS content into a scene and is recommended for non-technical users and users
      interested in getting up and running quickly for rapid prototyping

    text: <b>- C# Public API:</b> The C# Public API Scene demonstrates the most advanced
      usage of the plugin and contains a C# script that calls into the Public API.
      The code to make the scene functional is well commented and easy to understand;
      simply open the C# script with Visual Studio
